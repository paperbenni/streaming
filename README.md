# streaming

some scripts I use for live streaming

OBS configs are in my dotfiles repo. 

They contain a restream auth token, sadly there's no easy way to make
them public through yadm

## starting stream
```
./stream.sh
```

## ending stream
```
./endstream.sh
```

## Dependencies

My Stream assets
inter-fonts package

## Disclaimer

This is **highly** specific to my setup. It relies on my dotfiles,
instantOS utilities, instantOS assets and will probably not work on
any other setup as is. 

Please do however feel free to copy parts of this or to be inspired
by it.
